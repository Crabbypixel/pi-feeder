# Automated Pet Feeder with Raspberry Pi Zero 2W & Web Interface

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W to create an automated pet feeder controlled via a web interface. Users can remotely control the feeding schedule by activating servos to dispense food and using LEDs as indicators to show the feeding status.

## Features
- **Web-based control**: Control feeding schedules remotely via a simple web interface.
- **Servo control**: Dispenses pet food with accurate timing.
- **LED indicators**: Visual signals for feeding status (e.g., "Feeding in Progress," "Feeding Complete").
- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**: Compact and energy-efficient, ideal for DIY projects.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (or any Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi support)
- Servo motor(s)
- LEDs (for status indication)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- 5V Power supply for Raspberry Pi and servo motors
